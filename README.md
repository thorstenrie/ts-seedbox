# ts-seedbox
[RTorrent](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/wiki), [Archlinux](https://archlinux.org/) and [Podman](https://podman.io/) based container seedbox that tries to keep it simple ([KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)). It's purpose is to support distributing free software like Linux distro images (e.g., [Archlinux](https://archlinux.org/download/)). After set up is completed, just put torrent files into the *watch* directory and the download will be transferred to the *download* directory.
- **Setup guide**: Run through the setup guide to get started
- **Security**: rTorrent is run from a non-root system user
- **Functionality**: Pre-configured for use on a home/self-hosted server/device
- **Example included**: Use the example bash scripts to launch the container and start downloading and seeding the latest Archlinux image
