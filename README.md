# ts-seedbox
[RTorrent](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/wiki), [Archlinux](https://archlinux.org/) and [Podman](https://podman.io/) based container seedbox that tries to keep it simple ([KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)). One purpose could be to support distributing free software like Linux distro images if you can spare server and bandwidth ressources (e.g., [Archlinux](https://archlinux.org/download/)). After networking and set up is completed, just put torrent files into the container's *watch/start* directory and the file will be downloaded to the host *download* directory.

- **Security**: rTorrent is run from a non-root system user
- **Functionality**: Pre-configured for use on a home/self-hosted server
- **Easy setup**: Use the example shell scripts to launch the container and start downloading and seeding the latest Archlinux image

Two options to get it running:

- **Quick Start Guide**: Run the container with minimal effort by using provided example scripts (Warning: only recommended for development environments!)
- **Setup Guide**: Follow each step of the setup guide
